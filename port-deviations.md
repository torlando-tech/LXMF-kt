# LXMF-kt — Documented Deviations from the Python Reference

This file is the **single source of truth** for every place where LXMF-kt's logic intentionally diverges from `markqvist/LXMF`. Any divergence not listed here is a bug, not a deviation.

## Rule

> All logic in LXMF-kt MUST mirror the python reference identically. Deviations are allowed ONLY for one of two reasons, both of which MUST be documented here before the code lands.

**Allowed reason 1 — Language/runtime forced.** The python pattern cannot be expressed faithfully in kotlin or on the JVM. Examples: coroutines vs threads, `@Volatile` vs the GIL, `ReentrantLock` where python relies on GIL-implicit serialization, `kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking` boundaries at JVM/non-coroutine seams.

**Allowed reason 2 — New feature not present in python.** Kotlin-only API surface added for downstream consumers (Android lifecycle adapters, mobile-specific entry points, etc.). The kotlin-only behavior must not change semantics of any code path that *does* exist in python.

## Process

1. Before changing a kotlin port file in a way that diverges from the python reference, read the corresponding python source.
2. If the divergence is unavoidable for one of the two reasons above, add a section below using the template, then implement the change.
3. If you're unsure whether a divergence is justified, ask the human owner before picking unilaterally. Ports drift one small "harmless" choice at a time.
4. Reviewers should reject any PR that introduces a kotlin/python semantics divergence not represented in this file.

## Entry template

```markdown
### <short title> — <kotlin-file-relative-path>:<line-or-symbol>

**Python reference:** `<path>:<line>` (e.g. `LXMF/LXMRouter.py:2554-2580`)

**Category:** language/runtime forced  |  new feature

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Tracking:** issue/PR link, if any.

**Description:** what the kotlin code does, why it differs from python, and (for category 1) why no kotlin idiom can express the python semantics directly.

**Re-evaluation:** if a future kotlin/JVM/library change would make the python pattern expressible, what to look for.

## Deviations

### `@Volatile` on `LXMessage.progress` — `lxmf-core/src/main/kotlin/network/reticulum/lxmf/LXMessage.kt:142`

**Python reference:** `LXMF/LXMF/LXMessage.py:156` (`self.progress = 0.0`), with cross-thread writers at `LXMessage.py:474, 488, 496, 506, 512, 559, 571, 583, 618` (the `__update_transfer_progress` callback path) and reads from any caller polling for UI progress display.

**Category:** language/runtime forced

**Date:** 2026-05-12

**Tracking:** torlando-tech/LXMF-kt#34 (greptile review of `cmdLxmfGetMessageProgress`)

**Description:** Python's GIL serialises attribute reads/writes — `self.progress = X` from a Resource progress callback thread is implicitly visible to a main-thread poller without any explicit synchronisation. On the JVM, `var progress: Double = 0.0` has neither visibility nor atomicity guarantees: JLS §17.7 explicitly permits non-volatile `double` (and `long`) reads to **tear** (be observed as 32-bit halves of two different writes), and there is no happens-before edge between a write on one thread and a read on another without a synchronisation action. HotSpot makes 64-bit reads atomic in practice on modern hardware, but ART (Android Runtime) does not guarantee this, and visibility (vs atomicity) is implementation-defined either way. `@Volatile` is the direct JVM idiom for "what Python's GIL gives you for free": each read sees the latest committed write, and 64-bit access is guaranteed atomic.

Writers in this port: `LXMRouter.processOpportunisticDelivery` (LXMRouter.kt:739, 755) — `processingScope` coroutine; `LXMRouter.sendViaPropagation` Resource progressCallback (LXMRouter.kt:1258) — Resource background thread; `LXMRouter.sendViaLink` Resource progressCallback + completion callback (LXMRouter.kt:1335, 1340) — Resource background thread.

Readers: any consumer polling progress for UI display, plus `:conformance-bridge`'s `cmdLxmfGetMessageProgress` (Main.kt:740), which is what surfaced this issue in code review.

**Re-evaluation:** Remove `@Volatile` only if `LXMessage` ever migrates to an immutable / coroutine-`StateFlow`-backed progress representation, or if Kotlin gains a portable concurrency annotation that subsumes JVM-`@Volatile` semantics across all targets (Native, JS) the lib might one day support.
